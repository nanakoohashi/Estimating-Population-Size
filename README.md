# Estimating Population Size
## Summary
Using the U.S. Census Bureau's data on annual estimates of the population size of each U.S. state and region. In this project, I used R to create a linear regression model of the population dynamics of the state of Colorado and predicted the size of its population.

## Getting Started
### Dependencies
Windows 10

### Libraries
- ggplot2
- dplyr
- tidyr
- reshape2
- tidyverse
- ggpmisc
- broom

### Steps
1. Import Data.
2. Clean Data.
3. Create linear regression analysis.

## Main Findings
Using the linear regression equation, I estimated that the population of Colorado in the year 2024 will be 6,181,933.
